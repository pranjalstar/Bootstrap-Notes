A jumbotron indicates a big grey box for calling extra attention to some special content or information.

```html
<div class="jumbotron">
    <h1>Nothing is Useless ...</h1>
    <p class="lead">“It had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them. They went out and happened to things.” <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Hi there ! </a> </p>
    <p><a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Start Now before it's too late</a></p>
</div>
```

### Creating  Full Page Width Jumbotron
To create a jumbotron without rounded corners and that covers the full width of the viewport, place it outside all the containers, add the `.jumbotron-fluid` modifier class on it, and add a `.container` or `.container-fluid` within it.

`Example`
```html
<div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid">
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Learn to Create Websites</h1>
        <p class="lead">In today's world internet is the most popular way of connecting with the people...</p>
        <p><a href="#" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Start learning today</a></p>
    </div>
</div>
```
illustration of the code is as follows:
